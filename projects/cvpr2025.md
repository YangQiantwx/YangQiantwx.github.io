The **Perception for Industrial Robotics Automation (PIRA)** workshop at **CVPR 2025** serves as a technical bridge between academic research and real-world deployment in manufacturing. Our primary focus was on advancing robust perception systems for industrial robots, with special attention to embodied AI, foundation models, 3D scene understanding, and data-driven robot learning. The core attraction of the workshop was the **$60K Intrinsic Bin Picking Challenge**, which tasked participants with solving the complex problem of 6DoF object pose estimation in cluttered scenes using multi-camera industrial data.

As one of the workshop organizers, I contributed to both the technical planning and infrastructure that supported the challenge. My most substantial contribution was authoring the **official baseline repository**, which served as the foundation for all challenge participants. The codebase provides an end-to-end pipeline including object detection with **YOLOv11**, pose estimation with a custom **SimplePoseNet**, integration of multi-camera calibration parameters, and symmetry-aware loss for training on BOP-style datasets. The project emphasized clarity, modularity, and accessibility ‚Äî allowing even first-time users of 6DoF pose estimation to get started quickly and contribute competitively.
