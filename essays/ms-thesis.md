### üß† Abstract

In the realm of artificial intelligence, Automated Emotion Recognition (AER) has emerged as a pivotal area intersecting computer vision, NLP, and HCI. This thesis focuses on improving Facial Expression Recognition (FER), a core part of AER, through personalized modeling and emotional reaction intensity estimation.

Leveraging deep learning techniques‚Äîspecifically CNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers‚Äîthis work explores a novel suite of models designed to improve emotion classification. In particular, the study introduces a personalized CNN-LSTM approach and a CNN-Transformer method for emotional reaction intensity estimation.

**Key contributions include:**
- +1.5% improvement in accuracy with personalized FER models
- +8% gain in emotional intensity estimation (Pearson Correlation)
- Evaluation across multiple FER datasets
- Discussion of clinical relevance and future applications
