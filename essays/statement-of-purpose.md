        I first got into computer vision by working on facial expression recognition. I saw how tiny muscle changes show feelings and how a good feature extractor can learn from a small set of labeled images. When I started collecting my own video data, I noticed that using time information helps find patterns in movement and behavior that one image alone can’t show.

      <p class="fs-6">
        I believe foundation models are the next step. They learn from large amounts of unlabeled images, text, and video, so we don’t need as many labeled examples. In my work, I use self-supervised learning methods—both contrastive and generative—to capture detailed textures and overall scene info from videos of children. My goal is to combine pose estimation, attention maps, and action recognition into one system that gives clear visual summaries for doctors doing early ASD screening.

      <h3 class="fw-semibold">Why Computer Vision?</h3>
      <ul class="fs-6">
        <li>Lets computers see pixels and turn them into meaningful information.</li>

      <h3 class="fw-semibold">Why Foundation Models?</h3>
      <ul class="fs-6">
        <li>Learn from lots of raw data, so manual labeling is smaller.</li>
        <li>Link image and text patterns to work better on new tasks.</li>
        <li>Offer reusable parts for tasks like pose estimation and ASD detection.</li>

      <p class="fs-6">
        As a teaching assistant, I create lab exercises that focus on clear, repeatable results. I lead weekly sessions where students work together to fix data pipelines and understand model outputs. I also mentor undergraduates on open-source projects, helping them build data workflows, design simple annotation tools, and write scripts to test their ideas.

      <ul class="fs-6">
        <li>Wrote step-by-step tutorials on self-supervised learning and model interpretation.</li>
        <li>Ran peer-review meetings to improve code quality and documentation.</li>
        <li>Encourage an open, welcoming research group where all voices are heard.</li>
