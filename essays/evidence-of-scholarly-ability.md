Introduces the **Hashtag2Action (H2A)** pipeline that curates 283 k short-form video clips across 386 actions using adaptive hashtag mining and vision-based filtering for self-supervised VideoMAE V2 pre-training. Achieves competitive accuracy on UCF101, HMDB51, Kinetics-400, and SSv2 using only 20 % of the original pre-training data.
